-- When a button is pressed, we need to check whether we are playing or not.
-- We can potentially avoid this first check if we make sure a button will
-- never be pressable if the game is paused (e.g. by putting a layer
-- on top that says "Game paused").
-- Anyway:
-- In case we are not playing, nothing happens.
-- If we are playing, we need to check whether a sequence is playing or not.
---- In case the sequence is playing, nothing happens.
---- If the sequence is not playing, it means we need to check whether the
---- inputSequence has been fully provided.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---- Assuming we are playing and the sequence is not playing (i.e. the game
---- just got an input)
------ If inputSequence has been fully provided then
------ Next level!
------ else we need to check whether we can update the inputSequence or not.
-------- If the last input is correct then
-------- update the inputSequence
-------- else reset the game.
-- Additionally, we also need to update the state of the button to
-- pressed = True
-- and all the other buttons to False.
-- This is to ensure the button gets styled correctly.
